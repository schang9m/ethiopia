            <p>Jason was born in Port Alberni in 1996. Growing up, he was very competitive with his older brother in many video games,
			particularly Super Smash Brothers. Jason took interest in games and computers, so much so that he decided to go to BCIT
			in order to learn more about them. Jason's favourite teacher at BCIT is Paul Rozman, but don't tell Medhat that.</p>
