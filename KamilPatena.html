            <p>Kamil was born in Manila, Philliphines where he grew up eating mangos and coconuts.
            He lived in the Philliphines for the first five years of his life until his parents decided to move 
            to Canada. He was very depressed at that time because he missed all his friends and relatives he left 
            behind. However, as he grew up in Canada, he found new enjoyment in video games and the cold. He was so 
            interested in gaming that he decided to take a programming course in BCIT and took the CST program.
            He is currently trying his best in his studies and one of his favourite professors in the program 
            is Medhat Elmsary.</p>
