            <p>Tony was born in Seoul, South Korea but immigrated to Canada when he was three years old.
            Tony was interested in computers ever since he was a kid. He was fascinated about their functionality.
            He first started coding when he stumbled upon a page called "Neopets" where he was prompted to create
            a personal profile webpage where he used basic HTML skills to build it. He hopes to graduate in 2016.
            Tony's interest is edging towards mobile apps or game development. </p>
